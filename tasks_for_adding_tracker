As a logged in user:
I want to enter Stage Time in minutes
And SAVE minutes.


User must have attribute: Stage Time to date.

Show.html.erb must have form for entering time

1. Create tests:
	User profile page has content: "enter stage time"
	User should have attribute: Stage Time
	Adding time should update attr Stage Time by adding new time to total

2. Add form to show.html.erb

3. Add User attribute Stage Time

4. submit button => StageTime += Stagetime
